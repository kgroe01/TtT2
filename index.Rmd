# Welcome to My Website


This is a static website that I created.
<br>This is where we could say "please log in to view/download content"
<br> this is a public website so this is where we could have a brief description or some pictures or something like that
<br><br> I made this site very very quickly as a proof of concept.  I would spend much more time making the end product look nicer 
<br> please notice the Frivicon (the icon on the web browser tab) I am quite proud of that part :)
